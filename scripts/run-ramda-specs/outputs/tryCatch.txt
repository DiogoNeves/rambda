    ✓ takes two functions and return a function
    1) returns a function with the same arity as the `tryer` function
    ✓ returns the value of the first function if it does not throw
    ✓ returns the value of the second function if the first function throws
    2) the second function gets passed the error object and the same arguments as the first function
